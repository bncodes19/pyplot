## Overview: Utilizing Matplotlib and pyplot

As part of my coursework through Northwest Missouri State University's Data Analytics program, this repository serves as practice with Matpllotlib and pyplot.

The tasks in the Python Notebook: [https://github.com/bncodes19/pyplot/pyplot.ipynb](https://github.com/bncodes19/pyplot/blob/master/pyplot.ipynb) are completed.

The notebook is then exported to HTML and stored here in this repository: [https://github.com/bncodes19/pyplot/pyplot.html](https://github.com/bncodes19/pyplot/blob/master/pyplot.html)

## How-to:
To save export a notebook as HTML (assuming the notebook is developed in VS Code and Jupyter is installed through pip3):
Open the command palette in VS Code with ```Command + Shift + P```
Select: ```Jupyter: Export to HTML```
